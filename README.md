# Deep Learning Udemy Course
## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the **A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning** course on Udemy! This repository contains my Colab notebooks that are products of the coding challenges provided in the course.
Each notebook corresponds to specific sections of the course and is crafted to reinforce the theoretical knowledge with practical implementations. 

## Contents

- Theory: In depth lectures of why deep learning models are built the way they are
- Math: The formulas and mechanisms of deep learning
- Implementation: How deep learning models are constructed in Python using the PyTorch library
- Intuition: Understanding which metaparameter configurations are the right choice, how to interpret the effects of regularization, etc.
- Python: Further coding knowledge with Python to produce optimized code in the PyTorch library
- Google-colab: Using Google Colab's services to run GPU enhanced programs for complext neural networks
- 
This course covers the following topics in Deep Learning:
- Math and statistics invovled with deep learning
- Gradient descent
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
- Overfitting and cross-validation
- Regularization
- Metparameters (activations and optimizers)
- Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs)
- Sourcing data and handling unbalanced datasets
- Measuring model performance
- Weight innitializations
- Autoencoders
- Running models on a GPU
- Convolution and transformations
- Convolutional Neaural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning
- Style transfer
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), GRU/LSTM
- Ethics of deep learning

Each lecture was accompanied by coding tutorials, additional exercises, coding challenges, and milestone projects. All of which were to reinforce the theories covered in the lectures.
